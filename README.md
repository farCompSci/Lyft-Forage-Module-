# Completed Lyft Module Challenge

In this module from TheForage.com I completed a set of tasks involving some Software Architecture Aspects in Python. <br/>

## What This Particular Task Involves
This task involved implementing a UTM Class Design from an earlier Task. The earlier task involved finding a behavioural pattern to implement the code best so that it could be robust and easy to modify and add conditions and components to test for. The preferred implementation was through the use of the factory software behavioural creation method. This code makes use of abstract classes / interfaces to implement the logic in that manner. 

## In This Task
I created abstract classes for each required component, including batteries and engines, for example. Then, each of these abstract classes had an associated implementation for each model listed by the task requirements. Finally, I created a Car Factory class, which had a method to to create all the available car models and implementing all the abstract classes and components. Every car model could be accessed through the Car Factory Class. 

## Testing 
In regards to testing, I was encouraged to complete this code using Test-driven development. Using unit tests allowed me to make sure that I was able to achieve what I was aiming to achieve and make sure everything was implemented correctly

## In Conclusion
This project taught me several skills related to software engineering, such as Behavioural Software Patterns, Test-Driven Devlopment, Object-oriented Programming, Code Refactoring and Interpreting, Python Unit Testing, and problem solving
